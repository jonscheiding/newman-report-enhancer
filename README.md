# Newman Report Enhancer

This is a Chrome extension that provides some enhancements to Postman's Newman reports.

## Features

### Highlight Failures

A button will be added to the top of the report that allows you to highlight the failed tests.  They will be colored with a red header, and the non-failed tests will be collapsed.

## Installation

This extension is not in the Chrome extension store.  It must be installed manually.

1. Clone the repo somewhere.
2. Open Chrome and click _⠇ → More Tools → Extensions_
3. Click the _Load unpacked_ button.
    - If you don't see this button, make sure the _Developer mode_ toggle is enabled.
4. Browse to and select the folder where you cloned the repo.
5. Open a Newman report HTML file and confirm that you see the "Highlight Failures" button.
